Task Spaces
===========

Syllabus provides the TaskSpace class as a way to represent the entire space of classes
that are playable in an environment. This is necessary for sampling tasks from the
entire task space.

Usage 
^^^^^
You can define a Discrete task space by providing either a Discrete gym space or an integer to the constructor:

.. code-block:: python

   from gym.spaces import Discrete
   from syllabus.task_space import TaskSpace

   # You can provide a gym space
   task_space = TaskSpace(Discrete(200))
   # Or just an integer
   task_space = TaskSpace(200)

Future Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component is currently a work in progress. Future versions will include:

- Mutable Task Spaces

- Train, test, and validation splits over the task space

- Support for more complex task spaces (currently only Discrete, MultiDiscrete, and Box spaces are fully supported)
