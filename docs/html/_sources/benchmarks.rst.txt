Benchmarks
==========

We're actively working on testing and benchmarking the Syllabus implementations of curriculum learning algorithms.
For now only Domain Randomization and Prioritized Level Replay been evaluated to match baseline performance.

Our benchmark data is publically available at our weights and biases page, and we will continue to update it as we test more methods.
