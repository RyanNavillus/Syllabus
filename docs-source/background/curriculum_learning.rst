Curriculum Learning
===================

One day this page will include a proper introduction to curriculum learning. For now, here are a couple papers:

`Curriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning Domains: A Framework and Survey <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04960.pdf>`_
`Emergent Complexity and Zero-shot Transfer via Unsupervised Environment Design <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02096>`_
`Automatic Curriculum Learning For Deep RL: A Short Survey <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04664>`_
